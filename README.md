# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

**About:** I have based my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project on a fan page for Australian rock band ACDC.
I plan to create a clear, easy and well-structured fan page so that people of all ages can find information about the band 
and up coming gigs with ease.

**Personal reason** I choose ACDC because I've been a huge fan for a number of year's.
I love their music and i also love the colour's associated with the band. Another reason for this fan page is that the majority
of ACDC fans would be in their twilight years and may find it hard to navigate ACDC's official fan page because theirs a lot happening
on the page. As a younger ACDC fan i find it easy to locate and access information about the band but i can see why older people would 
find the fan pages overwhelming. So with all this in mind i plan to make my page very clear and easy to navigate. 

**Business opportunities:**
* Advertising for new and up coming rock bands.
* Advertising for music venues and bars.
* Advertising for music shops and music instruments.

**Users benefits**
* Clear and easy access to information about the band.
* List of band members throughout the years.
* The Bands tour dates and up coming gigs.
* Find out the history of the band.


UX:

My project is a ACDC fan page. 

The first step of my ux designs was finding out what a ACDC fan would like to see on my page.
So i asked a few friend's who are huge ACDC fan's. After only a few minutes we come up with a list.

1:videos of ACDC'S music
2;band info
3:pictures of the band
4:links to the bands social media
5:link to ACDC official store.

With all my research done and my ideas ready to go i started my wireframes.

Once i finished my wireframes i showed them to my friends (users) and they approved.
I then picked my colours and images for my site.
Now i was ready to start coding.



Features:

Nav bar: I used the same nav bar from the mini project with Bootstrap 4.
I also have links at the bottom off my wedsite to ACDC'S facebook,twitter
 and their official web store.

Embedded videos: I used embedded videos on my home so that the user could listen to ACDC while visiting my site.


Testing:

I tested my website on a number of browsers,mobile devices and tablets to ensure
everything looks good on all screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

Html
Css
Bootstrap
Font awesome
Hover css

Credits:

Content:

I used most of my own content except the bands history on my about page. 
I got the content of my paragraph from ACDC'S Wikipedia page.

Media:

I copied my pictuces of the band from the official ACDC wedsite and resized them myself.
I got the image in my header from google and saved it to my desktop.
The background images on my index html page and band page i also got from google.


Acknowledgements:

90% of my layout and structure code(nav bar,header,footer) is from mini project with Bootstrap 4(Resume project).
I used alot of the code because i liked how it looked and how easy it was to get around the site.
I also used the code because i am not an expert on bootstrap yet and found it difficult to use.
I also copied the code from the ACDC official site for the pictuces and layout of the band page. 
I used this code again on my index html page (Home page) to position the embedded videos the same as the pictures on the band page.
