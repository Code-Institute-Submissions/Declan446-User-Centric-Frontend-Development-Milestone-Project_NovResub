# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

**About:** I have based my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project on a fan page for Australian rock band ACDC.
I plan to create a clear, easy and well-structured fan page so that people of all ages can find information about the band 
and up coming gigs with ease.

**Personal reason** I choose ACDC because I've been a huge fan for a number of year's.
I love their music and i also love the colour's associated with the band. Another reason for this fan page is that the majority
of ACDC fans would be in their twilight years and may find it hard to navigate ACDC's official fan page because theirs a lot happening
on the page. As a younger ACDC fan i find it easy to locate and access information about the band but i can see why older people would 
find the fan pages overwhelming. So with all this in mind i plan to make my page very clear and easy to navigate. 

**Business opportunities:**
* Advertising for new and up coming rock bands.
* Advertising for music venues and bars.
* Advertising for music shops and music instruments.

**Users benefits**
* Clear and easy access to information about the band.
* List of band members throughout the years.
* The Bands tour dates and up coming gigs.
* Find out the history of the band.

# UX Design 

The first thing i did in regards to *UX design* was finding out what a ACDC fan would like to see on my page.
So i asked a few friend's who are also huge ACDC fan's. After only a few minutes we come up with a list.
* Live videos of ACDC's gigs.
* Information about the band members.
* Pictures of the band.
* links to the bands official social media pages.
* A link to ACDC's official store.

**Users benefits**
* Users of all ages will be able to navigate the site without becoming overwhelmed.
* Users will be able to listen to videos of ACDC's music with ease.
* Users can find information and pictures of the bands members with one click of the mouse.
* Users will find tickets to the bands shows when they start touring again. 

**Users Stories**

2. As a user and fan, i would like to see pictures of the band members.

# Design

**Logo:**
For my logo i choose a picture of *A deserted highway with a red sky in the background*. I choose this picture to represent
one of ACDC's most famous songs *Highway to Hell*. I added the bands name with a lighten bolt in the middle. To finish the logo i 
used my favourite ACDC lyrics *ITS A LONG WAY TO THE TOP IF YOU WANT TO ROCK & ROLL*

**Colours:**
The only colours used for this fan page was red, black, Goldenrod and blue. These colours were used because they represent the band perfectly.
* *Red* was used for the background colour for the nav bar and footer to make the icons pop. It was also used for the lyrics in the logo.
* *Black* was used for the icons in the nav bar and footer so they would stand out well from the red background. It was also used for the section background.
* *Goldenrod* was used for all text on the fan page.
* *Blue* was used for social media and official store links in the footer.

**Icons**
All the icons used in the navbar and footer came from Font Awesome.

**Planning**

1. I decided to create a fan page on the band ACDC that users could find information, videos and pictuces of ACDC with ease.
2. I talked to potential users and found out their needs.
3. Users needs are as follows: fast, easy to navigate and to find out more about ACDC.
4. I picked the colours for the page.
5. Picked my image for my logo (*A deserted highway with a red sky in the background*).
6. Decided what my pages were going to be in my navbar (Home, About, The Band, and Tickets).
7. Picked the features that the fan page would have.
8. Designed my wireframes.
9. Picked my music videos and images for the band members.
10. Found the links for the Bands official social media accounts and official store.
11. Then i opened gitpod and started coding.

**Wireframes**
I used Balsamiq cloud to develope my wirefames because i was able to create wirefames for large screen sizes and mobile screen sizes.
Balsamiq cloud is a great tool for creating very professional wireframes.

# Features

**Nav Bar:** The nar bar has four links to the pages of the web site(Home, About, The Band and Tickets) 

**Footer:** The footer has three links in it to ACDC's twitter,facebook and official store.

**Embedded Videos:** I used embedded videos on my home page so that the user could listen to ACDC while visiting the site.

# Technologies Used
The main Technologies used for the ACDC fan page were as follows:
* **Gitpod** was used as the IDE for building the ACDC fan page.
* **GitHub** was used to store the project remotely and used to deploy the project
* **HTML** was used to structure the web pages.
* **CSS** was used for the styling.
* **Bootstrap** was used for most of the features and functionality.
* **Font Awesome** was used for the icons.

 # Testing:
 I tested my fan page on google chrome, internet explorer, firefox and safari and found no problems displaying the pages
 in any browser. The project was also tested on all screen sizes.
* Galaxy S5 = No problems.
* Pixel 2 and 2 XL = No problems.
* Iphone 5 = No problems.
* Iphone 6/7/8 = No problems.
* Iphone 5 = No problems.
* Ipads = No problems

# Credits:

I used most of my own content except the bands history on the about page. 
I got the content of the paragraph from ACDC'S Wikipedia page.

**Media:**
I copied my pictuces of the band from the official ACDC wedsite and resized them myself.

[ACDC](https://pwrup.acdc.com/).
I got the image in my header from google and saved it to my desktop.



Acknowledgements:

90% of my layout and structure code(nav bar,header,footer) is from mini project with Bootstrap 4(Resume project).
I used alot of the code because i liked how it looked and how easy it was to get around the site.
I also used the code because i am not an expert on bootstrap yet and found it difficult to use.
I also copied the code from the ACDC official site for the pictuces and layout of the band page. 
I used this code again on my index html page (Home page) to position the embedded videos the same as the pictures on the band page.
